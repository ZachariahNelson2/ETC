Based on the Human Baseline software update we can start to build the foundation of this sandbox community. This community needs to answer the following questions:
- What does equitable labor look like?
- What does equitable access look like?

All members of *Sandbox Community Alpha* have signed a Community Equity Contract that legally guarantees free equitable access towards all necessary systems in exchange for free equitable labor towards a necessary system.
## Equitable Labor
- All community members who sign this equity contract are obligated to work in a necessary community cooperative.
	- You are not obligated to work under the age of eighteen (18).
		- All hours worked under the age of eighteen (18) will be saved.
	- You are allowed to choose your place of work, pending availability.
		-  Necessary education will be provided.
	- Your **Lifetime Labor Obligation** equals half of your Life Expectancy in terms of years, down to the nearest quarter year.
		- Life Expectancy will be defined by your Healthcare Committees.
			- Your life expectancy will be determined by the year you turn eighteen years old.
		- Fulfilling your LLO will grant you unrestricted access towards necessary systems for the rest of your natural life without any labor obligations (i.e. Retirement).
	- Your **Cycle Labor Obligation** is defined by your Logistics Committees.
		- CLO is based on hours per cycle. Cycles can be divided weekly, biweekly, monthly, annually, etc.
		- ***Sandbox Community A* has a CLO of 24 hours per week.**
		- Additional labor does not grant any additional benefits towards necessary systems.
		- Fulfilling your CLO will grant you unrestricted access towards necessary systems.
			- Failure to fulfill your CLO may incur penalties for inequitable access.
		- You are allowed to work more than your CLO. Excess labor per cycle will be saved.
			- Saved hours can be used towards future CLOs (i.e. Paid Time Off).
			- Saved hours can be used towards your LLO (i.e. Early Retirement).
			- Saved hours cannot be transferred or exchanged to another person.
- All necessary systems are fulfilled by cooperatives, teams that equitably share responsibility of the operations of the coop.
	- Cooperatives are filled with members of the community.
	- All information about necessary systems is equitably shared amongst cooperatives through committees.
	- All participating cooperatives can send representatives towards committees.
	- Only maintenance of a necessary system counts towards the labor obligation of the individual.
		- This removes any unnecessary demand for growth from the cooperative.
		- System growth should only come from the natural growth of the community.
- Labor Exemptions
	- Retirement
		- Once you have fulfilled your LLO, you are considered retired.
		- You are exempt from all labor obligations in your community for the rest of your life.
		- You will keep equitable access to all necessary systems in the community.
		- You're allowed to continue to work, without obligation.
	- Paid Time Off
		- You can use saved hours towards future CLO to be temporarily exempt from your labor obligations.
		- Saved hours are tied to the community, not the coop.
		- You cannot be denied use of your PTO at anytime.
	- Age
		- No person under the age of 18 is obligated to perform necessary labor.
		- Because underage people have zero (0) labor obligation, all labor is considered excess and will be saved until they reach the age of eighteen (18).
	- Education
		- Time spent in education/training does not count towards your labor obligation.
		- All people are allowed to abate their labor obligation to pursue additional education.
			- Your community may limit how long you can abate your labor obligation depending on frequency, application, or results.
	- Medical
		- All people under medical attention will have their labor obligation paused until they are discharged.
			- You will keep your position at your coop.
			- Your coop may temporarily fill your position in your absence.
		- People with permanent disabilities may have their CLO reduced or voided.
			- Labor obligations affected by disabilities will be regulated by healthcare committees.
## Equitable Access
- All community members who sign this equity contract have free equitable access to all public necessary systems in the community, pending availability.
	- All public food systems
	- All public water systems
	- All public shelter systems
	- All public community systems
	- All public governance systems
	- All public logistics systems
	- All public infrastructure systems
	- All public healthcare systems
	- All public education systems
- All adult (18 years old) community members will be given private access and responsibility to one (1) residential shelter.
	- If the community members currently occupies a necessary residential shelter, they will remain and be given private access to that shelter.
		- Exclusive responsibility over a shelter will be honored for the natural life of the individual(s) or until the shelter responsibility is returned back to the community.
	- If the community member currently does not occupy a necessary residential shelter, they may choose an available shelter.
		- Shelter equity is defined by the space the residential shelter occupies as well as labor and resource requirements to maintain the shelter.
		- Shelters that fall outside of equitability may still be occupied with additional responsibility towards the occupant to maintain the shelter.
	- The occupying individual(s) responsible for a residential shelter are not the owners of the shelter.
		- If the occupying individual(s) fail to maintain the residential shelter to a point that compromises the safety of the occupying individual(s), community members, neighboring structures. Then the community may resume responsibility of the shelter and rehome the occupying individual(s) to an available and safe structure.
## Necessary Systems
### Food
Necessary food businesses will become equitably owned community cooperatives.
### Water
Necessary water businesses will become equitably owned community cooperatives.
### Shelter
Necessary shelter businesses will become equitably owned community cooperatives.

As an individual, you will be offered exclusive responsibility over one (1) residential shelter. You are allowed to customize your shelter to fit your needs, extensions to an existing structure will require community approval. Your community will provide regular shelter inspections and repairs.

In the event of uninhabitable damage to your shelter, you will be provided temporary shelter until repairs can be made. In the event of complete shelter destruction or eminent domain, you will be offered a replacement shelter with top priority access.
### Community
Necessary community businesses will become equitably owned community cooperatives.
### Governance
Information about necessary systems must be shared equitably throughout all cooperatives in the community. Information governance is performed through committees. Committees are filled with representatives from all cooperatives in the community. Cooperatives are not required to send representation.
All necessary systems will require committees to manage the following interactions:
- Information
	- Data
	- Standards
	- Regulations
	- Process
- Energy
	- Production
	- Maintenance
	- Service
- Access
	- Public
	- Private
The Healthcare Committees will determine the life expectancy each year for the community. The Logistics Committees will determine the labor hours per cycle for all necessary jobs within the community. The community will interact with their necessary systems mostly through access points and committees.
### Logistics
Necessary logistics businesses will become equitably owned community cooperatives.

As an individual, there are many opportunities to customize your working experience to best fit your goals. Assuming an individual has no severe medical conditions or accidents, the average life expectancy of an individual is around eighty (80) years, putting the LLO of that individual at forty (40) years. With a CLO of 24 hours a week, that individual is obligated to work 49,920 hours within their lifetime for their community.

If an individual only works the minimum CLO of 24 hours a week, it will take 40 years of labor to fulfill their LLO at the age of 58. If an individual works beyond their CLO, up to 40 hours a week, they can theoretically fulfill their LLO within 24 years at the age of 42 (this assumes the individual did not use any saved time for PTO). Working above your minimum CLO does not grant any additional benefits to accessing necessary systems. Retirement only applies to the community it was served in, if you move outside your community you may need to assume new labor obligations.

As a member of a coop, you are given the opportunity to be involved in the operations of the coop. Your coop may have additional requirements for operational opportunities. All members of a cooperatve can be elected as representatives of the cooperative in committee activity.
### Infrastructure
Necessary infrastructure businesses will become equitably owned community cooperatives.

### Healthcare
Necessary healthcare businesses will become equitably owned community cooperatives.

### Education
Necessary education businesses will become equitably owned community cooperatives.

## Feedback

### Questions
- How did you define the LLO and CLO?
	- LLO is based on current labor expectations. Most retirement expectations are around 65 years old, but varies wildly depending on cost of living, retirement savings, and income. To create equity amongst all people, we need to redefine our labor expectations to something that all people share equitably, time. We can reach a similar (if not better) retirement age by simply halving our life expectancy. Current life expectancy in a developed nation is around 80-85 years old. If we assume work starts at 18 years old, they would retire at around 60 years old.
	- CLO is a variable, which will be determined by each community based on the quality and access towards needs. If a community has simple and efficient needs with a lot of people, then the work per person goes down. If a community has a lot of complex systems and less people then the work per person goes up. That being said, because only necessary maintenance labor counts towards your CLO, there will be more people working towards necessary systems than in our current economy. I personally believe, and am targeting, that the average person only needs to give around **24 hours per week** in order to maintain the needs of the community.
- Why does all the work need to be run by a coop? What about private businesses?
	- Because we are only focuses on necessary labor, we cannot allow individuals or groups of people to exclusively own our needs and have the ability to control and influence the community. By making all needs equitable, the community can share in the responsibility of maintaining those needs. This is not to say that a coop can't be lead by an individual or group of people.
	- For example, a restaurant. You may want to open a restaurant because you are passionate about food and the culinary arts. You can join an existing restaurant as a chef and help influence that team with your ideas. Or you can start a new restaurant with a team of people to help manifest your vision. Being head chef does not grant you ownership over the restaurant, the whole team still equitably shares responsibility. If the team does not agree with how you are leading the coop, they can vote to remove you. No one is above the needs of the community and the people.
	- The only way to theoretically "own" a coop is by being it's only laborer, even still, the existence of that coop is determined by the needs of the community and people. If the community does not need or want your coop, then you may not be given the responsibility to start that coop.
