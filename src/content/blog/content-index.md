## About ETC
The ETC is a civil consultancy whose mission is to understand, explore, and transition our communities away from ownership and debt, towards an equitable community system.

The ETC has developed a new understanding of community that replaces the concepts of ownership and debt with responsibility and equity. This [Human Baseline](hb.html) puts our shared needs as our main priority, with equity as our goal and responsibility as our pride.

The ETC has also developed an [Economic Transition Plan](etp.html) to help communities redesign their private economic systems into public community systems. There is a lot of information to process, and you probably have a lot of questions. You can check out our [FAQ](faq.html) to help clarify some details, and you can [Contact](contact.html) us with your questions and feedback.
