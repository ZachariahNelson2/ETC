The Human Baseline is a new software package designed to maintain the needs of people and their communities. This software package introduces new software concepts to solidify our individual human needs, and our shared community needs.
### New Human Software
#### Human Life
- I exist
- I have needs
	- **Food**
	- **Water**
	- **Shelter**
	- **Community**
- My needs are as important to myself as they are for all people
#### Community
- A group of people existing in an area temporarily or permanently
- Communities have needs
	- **Governance**
	- **Logistics**
	- **Infrastructure**
	- **Healthcare**
	- **Education**

**Governance** is how we share information through committees, elections, legislation, representation, enforcement, etc. **Logistics** is how we share labor, through cooperatives, training, engineering, management, etc. **Infrastructure** is how we share access through land, utilities, hardware, software, public transit, structures, etc. **Healthcare** is how people maintain their bodies through medicine, surgery, therapy, nursing, etc. **Education** is how people maintain their community through understanding, schooling, training, mentoring, research, exploration, communication etc.

### Ownership Software Replacements
This software package also replaces our existing ownership software with equitable software. This allows humanity to continue to operate on a shared societal fabric without fear of losing access and labor towards our necessary systems.
#### Ownership - OLD
- Absolute and exclusive control
- Corruptible software that prioritizes the self above all other people.

Ownership needs to be replaced with software that gives the same personal satisfaction of control, but without the pride to mislead you into thinking youâ€™re above what you own.

#### Responsibility - NEW
- Expectation to temporarily control

Responsibility grants a person control over something, but does not grant permanent or exclusive control. This control is an expectation the community puts upon an individual for the good of the community.
<hr>

#### Conquest - OLD
- Expansion of ownership
- Increases capacity and corruption of ownership
- Unsustainable growth damages ecosystems

Conquest needs to be replaced with something that defines a goal but does not inhibit other people from accessing their needs.

#### Equity - NEW
- Share responsibility
- Defined goal for person and community needs
- Defined by interactions with needs
	- **Information**
	- **Energy (Labor)**
	- **Access**

Equity defines a goal for our needs while also considering the needs of the community and individual.
<hr>

#### Debt - OLD
- An imbalance of equity
- Allows owners to force debts
- Unnecessary financial systems

Debt needs to be replaced with something that consistently balanced the input and output of people in the community.

#### Obligation - NEW
- Required responsibility

Because all people have needs to fulfill, all people need to use shared resources. All people have an obligation to fulfill their needs, therefore all people have an obligation to share the labor to fulfill those needs.

<hr>

#### Competition - OLD
- Two, or more, parties attacking and defending against each other to achieve a greater outcome against the other party (see zero-sum game)
- Forces inequality within a community
- Unnecessary redundancy of necessary labor

Competition needs to be replaced with something that brings out the best in people, to perform above and beyond personal expectations, without the ego distraction of trying to be the best.

#### Cooperation - NEW
- Two, or more, parties work with each other to mutually achieve a greater outcome
- Equitably and efficiently sharing information, labor, and access

Because we all share the same needs, there is no need to fight each other to fulfill those needs, the whole point of a community is to work together to fulfill needs.

<hr>

#### Security - OLD
- Protection of ownership
- Further divides people and communities against each other

Security needs to be replaced with something that ensures the longevity of what we hold valuable without the fear of thinking our neighbors are our enemies.

#### Maintenance - NEW
- Protection of existence
- Defines the scope of our obligation and cooperation
	- We only need to maintain our needs, not exceed them

Maintenance sets the bar for our existence, it's what we must achieve to continue to live. Instead of forcing people to fight against each other, we can all share in the responsibility of maintaining our needs.

<hr>

#### Taxes - OLD
- Extension of debt
- Regular sacrifice to an owner
- Forces people into a perpetual debt they can never pay off

Taxes need to be replaced with something that legally binds people to the community without the fear of the community taking advantage of the people.

#### Contracts - NEW
- Legal mutual agreements between two, or more, parties
- Equitably obligates all people to the community

Contracts allow everyone to legally bind themselves to another person, or community. By sharing in the same contract, all people in a community can have an equal voice in how that contract is constructed. By defining how we access and labor towards our necessary systems, we can define for ourselves what is fair and equitable for all people.

<hr>

#### Currency - OLD
- Exchangeable debt
- Unnecessary middle-man with excessive and unnecessary labor demands to maintain
- Prioritizes wants the same as needs

Money, credit, securities, crypto, etc. will be deprecated. No replacements necessary.
